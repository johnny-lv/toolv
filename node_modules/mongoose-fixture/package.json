  "readme": "# Mongoose-Fixture\n\nInspired from Django's data-fixtures and Ruby's rake but built for nodejs.  Mongoose-Fixture is a command-line and utility library to load static json arrays/documents into mongodb.  Ideal for working with the [MEAN](http://blog.mongodb.org/post/49262866911/the-mean-stack-mongodb-expressjs-angularjs-and) stack. \n\n## Why would I use it?\n\nInstalling Mongodb will give access to the ``mongoimport`` command, however that is for simple importing and not flexible as a workflow-tool. \n\nMongoose-Fixture comes with the following features to improve developer workflow\n\n* Project Configuration, organize documents collections into sets, for custom batch executions\n* BoilerPlates, generate Schemas/Fixtures to reduce typing\n* API can be used within other processes, a nodejs event-emitter\n\n# Migrating to Release 0.3.0\n\nThere were api adjustments moving from version 0.2.x to 0.3.0, specifically within your data-fixtures.  In order to support the new 0.3.0 release you need to adjust the method signature in all your data fixtures.\n    \n    // 0.2.x data fixture method signature\n    module.exports = function(mongoose, callback){ \n        // function body\n    };\n\n    // new 0.3.0 data fixture method signature\n    module.exports = function(mongoose, conn, callback){\n        // function body\n    };\n\n# Getting Started\n\nRead the [documentation guide](http://mgan59.github.io/mongoose-fixture/) for a full-walkthrough and [sample project](https://github.com/mgan59/mongoose-fixture-example/)\n\n# New Development / Contribution\n\n* more tests\n* create a grunt hook, consider supporting own bin command?\n* more documentation (specifically examples)\n\n\n",
